Subject to the terms of this Agreement, Consultant will render the services set forth in Project Assignment(s) accepted by Consultant (the "Services") by the completion dates set forth therein.  Except as otherwise provided in the applicable Project Assignment, Consultant will have exclusive control over the manner and means of performing the Services, including the choice of place and time.  Consultant will provide, at Consultant's own expense, a place of work and all equipment, tools and other materials necessary to complete the Services; however, to the extent necessary to facilitate performance of the Services, Client may, in its discretion, make its equipment or facilities available to Consultant at Consultant's request.  While on the Client's premises, Consultant agrees to comply with Client's then-current access rules and procedures, including those related to safety, security and confidentiality.  Consultant agrees and acknowledges that Consultant has no expectation of privacy with respect to Client's telecommunications, networking or information processing systems (including stored computer files, email messages and voice messages) and that Consultant's activities, including the sending or receiving of any files or messages, on or using those systems may be monitored, and the contents of such files and messages may be reviewed and disclosed, at any time, without notice

Payment of Consultant's fees and expenses will be in accordance with terms and conditions set forth in the applicable Project Assignment.  Upon termination of this Agreement for any reason, Consultant will be paid fees on the basis stated in the Project Assignment(s) for work which has been completed.
